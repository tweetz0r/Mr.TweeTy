# Essential Data Science Extension Pack

## A collection of extensions for data science in VS Code

This extension pack aims to reduce the friction of configuring Visual Studio Code as a data science platform by collecting together a set of extensions that can be installed and managed in a single operation.

Once installed, the extension pack enables the data scientist to work more efficiently, reducing the need to leave the environment to access external tools.
